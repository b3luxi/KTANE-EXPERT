# KTANE-EXPERT
A basic web page that can be used as a notepad for an expert playing KTANE.

The goal of this project is just for me to pratice what I have been learning so far in terms of JS, CSS and HTML.

This is somewhat of a cheating way of playing the game if you are an expert since in my view, you are not supposed to have a clock (since the rules of the game
 make it that you should not have access to visual aids), and the FMN part is making the math for you, which you should be doing it yourself :)
 
But this FMN coding part was a fun way of testing what I could do.

This is my first ever take on programming, and I know that most of what is here is garbage :)

I use a lot of .value which are not the correct way of programming.
